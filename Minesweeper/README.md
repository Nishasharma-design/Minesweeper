## MVP
- Recreate a simplified version of the game Minesweeper to be played in the java console The game should be able to randomly generate 10 mines in a 10x10 grid The user will be able to enter a command that represents a coordinate to check a location for a mine The application will display a number from 0-8 depending on how many mines surround that location If the user selects a mine, the game will respond "boom!" and the game will be lost If every non-mine square has been revealed, the game is won Render the grid to the console after every user command

## Requirements / Purpose
- I used Java to create the Minesweeper project
- Projects lets the user play Mineweeper game 

## Future Goals
- For better user experience, I might want to give some instructions before the user input the numbers

## Struggle
- I felt it was a simple project to build.
- This project helped me learn so much about Java
- It was a beautiful experience.
